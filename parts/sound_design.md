Also, historically there was a number of environments to do sound synthesis with code - starting from CSound, [going through an abundance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_audio_synthesis_environments). My understanding is that [SuperCollider](https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/awesome-supercollider), Max/MSP and PureData are the most alive now.
