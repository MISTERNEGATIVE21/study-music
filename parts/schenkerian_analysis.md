5. Diergarten/Neuwirth, when publishing a modern study book on form (2019), [explicitly say](https://storage.gmth.de/zgmth/pdf/1034) that, while they base their book on Marx/Ratz/Schoenberg, Darcy/Hepokoski and Caplin, "Strategies  geared  towards  Heinrich  Schenker  are  not  central  to  the  book  (regardless  of  this,  superordinate  frameworks  are  occasionally  included  for  illustration  purposes)"

- [A Generative Theory of Tonal Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_theory_of_tonal_music) - An attempt to build a generative grammar for common-practice (pre-20-century) music. This work is also continued in [the essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Constraints_on_Compositional_Systems), [the second book](https://amzn.to/3FRzPn1) where the switch from generative grammar to preference rules occurs, and the path is reflected in [the third one](https://amzn.to/3fJCm8p).

- [Jason Yust. Organized Time: Rhythm, Tonality, and Form](https://amzn.to/3BlTlaU) - not necessarily Schenkerian, but illustrations have that flavour of reductionism
